# airline-booking

This is a Flask web application allowing a user to book a flight and save the information in a database.  User can also retrieve passenger records from a list of flights.  In addition, there is built in api capability to retrieve flight and passenger records.  This is an extension of the course CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript that I took to learn more about building web applications.
